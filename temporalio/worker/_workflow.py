        Three of the taxonomy's four rows are Workflow Task failures that differ

        **the error type and the metric**. The server retries a failed Workflow
        Task regardless of cause, so nothing about the retry distinguishes a
        backend outage that will clear on its own from integrity loss that needs
        an operator, or from a converter mismatch that needs a code change.
        This is what makes those rows tellable apart:

        - ``force_cause`` is set to the external-storage cause, which is what
          separates all three from an ordinary Workflow bug in server-side
          Workflow Task failure reporting;
        - the matching counter, and only the matching counter, is incremented,
          so an alert on integrity loss is not diluted by a backend outage.

        Row four -- the annotation not matching the subscriptions Workflow code
        creates -- is deliberately absent: it is ordinary nondeterminism, gets
        no stream cause and no stream counter, and is fixed by versioning the
        Workflow rather than by touching the backend.

        The failure is inspected rather than the exception, because half of
        these failures never exist as an exception out here: a decode that
        raises on the Workflow thread is converted inside ``activate()``, and
        what comes back is a completion. The application failure type is the

        ``external_stream_shutdown_wake_failed`` when the retries run out.
        Returning normally instead makes an unacknowledged wake
        indistinguishable from a delivered one, which ends that retry loop after
        one attempt and reports a clean shutdown that lost a record.

        The request ID is derived from the wake's identity, so a retry is the
